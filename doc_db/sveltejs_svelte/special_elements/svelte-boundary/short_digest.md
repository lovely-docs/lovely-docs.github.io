Error boundary element that catches rendering/effect errors and shows pending UI for `await` expressions. Provides `pending` snippet for loading state, `failed` snippet for error UI with `error` and `reset` arguments, and `onerror` handler for error tracking. Does not catch errors in event handlers or async work outside rendering.
