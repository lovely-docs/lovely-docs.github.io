Reactive wrappers for DOM APIs (focus, visibility, measurements, observers), user interaction (keyboard, idle, clicks), async data (resource fetching, persistence), state management (context, debounce, throttle, history, undo/redo), event handling, and specialized utilities (textarea autosize, FSM, geolocation, URL search params, debounce/throttle).
