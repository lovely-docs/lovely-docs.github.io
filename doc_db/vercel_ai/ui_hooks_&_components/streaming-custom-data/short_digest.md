Stream custom data alongside model responses using `createUIMessageStream` and `writer.write()`. Three data types: persistent data parts (added to `message.parts`), sources (for RAG), and transient parts (only via `onData` callback, not in history). Data parts with same ID auto-reconcile on client. Process on client via `onData` callback for transient data and by filtering `message.parts` for persistent data.
