Module available only to service workers that provides build and deployment metadata.

**Imports:**
```js
import { base, build, files, prerendered, version } from '$service-worker';
```

**base** (string): The base path of the deployment, calculated from `location.pathname`. Equivalent to `config.kit.paths.base` but works correctly when deployed to subdirectories. Note: `assets` is not available since service workers cannot be used with `config.kit.paths.assets`.

**build** (string[]): Array of URL strings for files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with `cache.addAll(build)`. Empty during development.

**files** (string[]): Array of URL strings for files in the static directory (or `config.kit.files.assets`). Customizable via `config.kit.serviceWorker.files`.

**prerendered** (string[]): Array of pathnames for prerendered pages and endpoints. Empty during development.

**version** (string): From `config.kit.version`. Useful for generating unique cache names so later deployments can invalidate old caches.
