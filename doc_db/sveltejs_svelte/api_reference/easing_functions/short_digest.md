The `svelte/easing` module exports 32 easing functions for animations: `linear`, quadratic (`quadIn/Out/InOut`), cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, exponential, circular, back, bounce, and elastic variants. Each takes a normalized time value and returns an eased value.

Import: `import { cubicInOut } from 'svelte/easing';`
