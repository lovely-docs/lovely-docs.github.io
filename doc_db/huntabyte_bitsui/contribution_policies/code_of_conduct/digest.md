## Community Guidelines

- **Be Respectful** – Treat everyone with respect, even when you disagree. Personal attacks, harassment, and aggressive behavior are not tolerated.
- **Be Constructive** – Focus on productive discussions and feedback. Avoid negativity without offering solutions.
- **Follow Contribution Guidelines** – Feature requests should start as discussions before being considered for implementation. Issues should be limited to confirmed bugs or accepted feature requests ready for development.
- **Keep Discussions On-Topic** – Use the appropriate channels for discussions, issues, and pull requests to keep the project organized and efficient.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Personal attacks, insults, threats, harassment, bullying, intimidation, discrimination, spamming, trolling, deliberately disruptive behavior, and sharing private information without consent are not tolerated.

## Enforcement

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Serious violations may result in temporary or permanent bans. Report unacceptable behavior to project maintainers.

This applies to all project spaces: GitHub (issues, discussions, pull requests), Discord, and other official communication platforms.
