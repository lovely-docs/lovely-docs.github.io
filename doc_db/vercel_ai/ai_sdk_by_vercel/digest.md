The AI SDK is a TypeScript toolkit for building AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. It standardizes integration with large language models (LLMs) across multiple supported providers, allowing developers to focus on building applications rather than handling provider-specific technical details.

The SDK consists of two main libraries:
- AI SDK Core: Unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs
- AI SDK UI: Framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interfaces

The SDK supports multiple model providers including official integrations. Templates are available for different use cases, providers, and frameworks, organized into categories: starter kits, feature exploration, frameworks, generative UI, and security.

The entire AI SDK documentation is available in Markdown format at ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt for use with LLMs like Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and Claude. This allows developers to ask questions about the SDK by copying the documentation and using a prompt format that includes the documentation followed by their question.

Community support is available through the Vercel Community forum.
