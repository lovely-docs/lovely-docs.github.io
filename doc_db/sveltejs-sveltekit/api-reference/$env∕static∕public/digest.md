The `$env/static/public` module provides access to public environment variables that are statically injected at build time. These variables are safe to expose in client-side code since they're intended to be public. They must be prefixed with `PUBLIC_` in your `.env` file to be included in this module. Use this for configuration values that need to be accessible from the browser, such as API endpoints or feature flags.
