**Breaking changes**: Remove `:dialect` from CLI commands, add mandatory `dialect` to config, replace `connectionString`/`uri` with `url`. Optional `driver` for special cases. Snapshots upgrade to v6 via `drizzle-kit up`. Auto-selects drivers by dialect. **New features**: Relation extraction from foreign keys, custom migration names with `--name`, new `drizzle-kit migrate` command with configurable storage table/schema.
