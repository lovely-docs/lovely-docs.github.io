Install `@sveltejs/adapter-netlify` and configure `svelte.config.js` with `edge` and `split` options. Create `netlify.toml` with build command and publish directory. Use `edge: true` for Deno-based edge functions. Access Netlify context via `event.platform?.context`. Use `_redirects` file for redirects (higher priority than `netlify.toml`). For file system access, use `read()` from `$app/server` instead of `fs`.
