''}\">\n\tclick me\n\u003C/button>\n\n\u003Cstyle>\n\t.variant-danger {\n\t\tbackground: red;\n\t}\n\u003C/style>\n```\n\nIn Svelte 3/4 using `$$props` and `$$restProps` creates a modest performance penalty, so they should only be used when needed.\n","## $$props and $$restProps in Legacy Mode\n\nIn legacy mode (non-runes), use `$$props` and `$$restProps` to work with component props:\n\n- **`$$props`**: Object containing all props passed to the component, including undeclared ones\n- **`$$restProps`**: Object containing all props except those individually declared with `export`\n\n### Example: Button Component\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cscript>\n\texport let variant;\n\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cbutton {...$$restProps} class=\"variant-{variant} {$$props.class ?? ''}\">\n\tclick me\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\nHere, `variant` is explicitly exported, so it's excluded from `$$restProps`. The `$$restProps` are spread onto the button element, and `$$props.class` is used to merge any class prop with the variant class.\n\n### Performance Note\n\nIn Svelte 3/4, using `$$props` and `$$restProps` incurs a modest performance penalty, so use them only when necessary.","## $$props and $$restProps\n\n- **`$$props`**: All props passed to component\n- **`$$restProps`**: All props except those declared with `export`\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cscript>\n\texport let variant;\n\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cbutton {...$$restProps} class=\"variant-{variant} {$$props.class ??
