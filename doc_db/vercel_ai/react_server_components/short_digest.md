Experimental RSC package for streaming React Server Components from server to client. Core: `streamUI` (calls model returning components), `useUIState`/`useAIState` (state hooks), `useActions` (server action access), `createAI` (context provider). Split state into AI State (serializable JSON for LLM) and UI State (client-only React elements). `createStreamableValue`/`createStreamableUI` for granular streaming control. Tools use async generators to yield loading states before final UI. Multi-step interfaces via tool composition and client interactivity. Three loading patterns: client-side state, server-streamed state, or streaming components. Error handling via `.error()` method or try-catch. Protect Server Actions with token validation. Experimental; migrate to AI SDK UI for production (separate generation in route handler from rendering with `useChat`).
