SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications with Svelte, similar to Next.js (for React) or Nuxt (for Vue). It handles modern development best practices including routing, build optimizations, offline support, preloading, configurable rendering (SSR, CSR, prerendering), and image optimization. Svelte is a compiler that converts UI components into JavaScript and CSS. SvelteKit builds on Svelte by providing the full application framework with features like Hot Module Replacement via Vite for instant code reflection during development.
