Bits UI documentation is available in LLM-friendly format following the llms.txt standard for machine-readable documentation.

**Accessing LLM-friendly versions:**
- Append `/llms.txt` to any documentation page URL (e.g., `bits-ui.com/docs/components/accordion/llms.txt`)
- Use the "Copy Markdown" button at the top of each page to copy content in Markdown format
- Access the root index at `bits-ui.com/llms.txt` for a list of all compatible pages
- View complete consolidated documentation at `bits-ui.com/docs/llms.txt`

**Important notes:**
- Not all pages support the `/llms.txt` suffix (e.g., Figma page)
- Check the root llms.txt page for current list of compatible URLs
- The "Copy Markdown" button provides the same content as the `/llms.txt` endpoint
