**v0.11.0-v0.32.2 release progression**: Core ORM (typed schema, queries, joins, migrations) → constraints & performance (UNIQUE, lateral joins, 430% IntelliSense speedup) → query building & drivers (dynamic queries, read replicas, set operators, Expo/Neon/PGlite/Xata/TiDB drivers) → timestamp fixes & advanced features (pg_vector, PostGIS, identity columns, generated columns, Prisma integration, live queries). Key additions: `.$dynamic()` for dynamic building, `withReplicas()` for read replicas, `$returningId()` for MySQL, `.if()` for conditional WHERE, `useLiveQuery` hook, ESLint plugin, aggregate helpers, set operators (UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT).
