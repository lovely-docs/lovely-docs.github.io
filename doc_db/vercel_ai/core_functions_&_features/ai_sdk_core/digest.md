AI SDK Core is the foundation for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI capabilities. It provides comprehensive functionality across multiple domains:

**Text Generation**: Generate text using LLMs with configurable settings and parameters.

**Structured Data Generation**: Generate and validate structured data outputs from language models.

**Tool Calling**: Enable LLMs to call external tools and functions, allowing models to interact with external systems and APIs.

**Prompt Engineering**: Techniques and best practices for writing effective prompts to get better results from language models.

**Settings**: Configure generation parameters for language models including temperature, max tokens, and other model-specific settings.

**Embeddings**: Convert text into vector embeddings for semantic search, similarity comparison, and other ML tasks.

**Image Generation**: Generate images using AI models.

**Transcription**: Convert audio files to text using transcription models.

**Speech**: Generate spoken audio from text using text-to-speech models.

**Provider Management**: Work with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with a unified interface.

**Middleware**: Intercept and modify requests/responses in the AI pipeline for logging, validation, or transformation.

**Error Handling**: Proper error handling patterns and recovery strategies for AI operations.

**Testing**: Strategies and utilities for testing AI-powered applications.

**Telemetry**: Monitor and collect metrics about AI SDK usage and performance.
