## Accessibility (a11y_*)
Avoid `accesskey`, `autofocus`. Elements with `aria-activedescendant` need `tabindex`. Reserved elements (`meta`, `html`, `script`, `style`) can't have `aria-*` or `role`. Non-interactive elements (`h1-h6`, `p`, `img`, `li`, `ul`, `ol`, `main`, `area`) can't have event listeners or interactive roles. Interactive elements need keyboard handlers. `<figcaption>` must be immediate child of `<figure>`. `<video>` needs `<track kind="captions">`. Labels need associated controls. Images shouldn't say "image/photo/picture" in alt text. ARIA attributes must match role requirements and have correct types (boolean, ID, token, etc.). Avoid positive `tabindex`.

## Code Quality
Components need capital letters. Unused CSS selectors removed (use `:global()` for dynamic content). HTML elements auto-close (add explicit tags). No self-closing tags in HTML. Deprecated: `on:event` directive, `<slot>`, `<svelte:component>`, `<svelte:self>`, `context="module"`. Variables reassigned without `$state()` won't trigger updates. Reactive variables referenced after reassignment lose reactivity (wrap in function). Rest operator in `{#each}` breaks bindings. Bidirectional control characters can alter code behavior. Module-level reassignments don't trigger reactive statements. Custom elements need destructured `$props()` or explicit `customElement.props`.
