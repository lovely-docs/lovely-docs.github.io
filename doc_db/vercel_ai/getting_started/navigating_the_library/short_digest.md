AI SDK has three components: **Core** (unified LLM API for any JS environment), **UI** (streaming chat/generative UI hooks for React/Vue/Svelte), and **RSC** (experimental server-to-client streaming for Next.js App Router). Environment compatibility varies: Core works everywhere; UI in React/Vue/Svelte frameworks; RSC in Next.js App Router only. UI is recommended for production; RSC has limitations including no stream cancellation and potential quadratic data transfer.
