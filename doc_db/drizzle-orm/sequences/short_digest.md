PostgreSQL sequences generate unique sequential values for auto-incrementing identifiers. Create with `pgSequence("name", { startWith, maxValue, minValue, cycle, cache, increment })`. Features: nextval/currval/setval/lastval functions, OWNED BY associations, cycling, caching. Limitations: gaps from aborted transactions, out-of-order values across sessions, no rollback, crash recovery issues. Requires drizzle-orm@0.32.0+ and drizzle-kit@0.23.0+.
