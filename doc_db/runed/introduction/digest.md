Runed is a collection of utilities for Svelte 5 that extends Svelte Runes with powerful, reusable primitives for building applications and libraries.

**Key Features:**
- Powerful Utilities: Carefully crafted utility functions and classes that simplify common tasks and reduce boilerplate
- Collective Efforts: Community-driven single source of truth for utilities, allowing shared contributions and testing
- Consistency: Uniform APIs and behaviors across all utilities
- Reactivity First: Built on Svelte 5's reactivity system, designed to handle reactive state and side effects
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript support

**Design Principles:**
- Embrace the Magic of Runes: Fully leverages Svelte Runes as a powerful paradigm, making it feel natural and intuitive
- Enhance, Don't Replace: Extends Svelte's core functionality rather than replacing it; utilities feel like natural extensions
- Progressive Complexity: Simple things are simple, complex things are possible with advanced customization
- Open Source and Community Collaboration: MIT licensed, welcomes contributions including bug reports, feature requests, and code
