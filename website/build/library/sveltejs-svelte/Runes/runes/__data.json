They provide a way to declare reactive variables, derived values, and effects using special functions prefixed with `$`.\n\nKey runes include:\n- `$state`: Creates reactive state variables that automatically trigger updates when modified\n- `$derived`: Computes derived values that update whenever their dependencies change\n- `$effect`: Runs side effects when dependencies change, useful for synchronizing with external systems\n- `$watch`: Observes changes to specific values and runs callbacks\n\nRunes replace the previous reactivity model and are the recommended approach for managing component state and reactivity in modern Svelte applications.","Runes are Svelte's reactive primitives for state management. Key runes: `$state` for reactive variables, `$derived` for computed values, `$effect` for side effects, `$watch` for observing changes.","Runes are Svelte's core reactive primitives for managing state, derived values, and side effects in components."],"uses":{"params":["name","path"]}}]}
