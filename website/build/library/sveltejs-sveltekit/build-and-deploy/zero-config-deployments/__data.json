This adapter automatically installs and uses the correct adapter for supported environments when you deploy:\n\n- [`@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`](adapter-cloudflare) for [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)\n- [`@sveltejs/adapter-netlify`](adapter-netlify) for [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)\n- [`@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`](adapter-vercel) for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)\n- [`svelte-adapter-azure-swa`](https://github.com/geoffrich/svelte-adapter-azure-swa) for [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/)\n- [`svelte-kit-sst`](https://github.com/sst/v2/tree/master/packages/svelte-kit-sst) for [AWS via SST](https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/svelte)\n- [`@sveltejs/adapter-node`](adapter-node) for [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)\n\nIt's recommended to install the appropriate adapter to your `devDependencies` once you've settled on a target environment, since this will add the adapter to your lockfile and slightly improve install times on CI.\n\n## Environment-specific configuration\n\nTo add configuration options, such as `{ edge: true }` in [`adapter-vercel`](adapter-vercel) and [`adapter-netlify`](adapter-netlify), you must install the underlying adapter — `adapter-auto` does not take any options.\n\n## Adding community adapters\n\nYou can add zero-config support for additional adapters by editing [adapters.js](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/main/packages/adapter-auto/adapters.js) and opening a pull request.\n","**adapter-auto** automatically detects and uses the correct deployment adapter for your environment.

This adds it to your lockfile and improves CI install times.\n\nTo use environment-specific configuration options (like `{ edge: true }` in adapter-vercel or adapter-netlify), you must install the underlying adapter directly — adapter-auto doesn't accept options.\n\nCommunity adapters can be added to zero-config support by editing adapters.js in the adapter-auto package and submitting a pull request.","**adapter-auto** automatically selects the correct deployment adapter based on your environment (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Azure Static Web Apps, AWS SST, or Google Cloud Run).\n\nInstall the specific adapter to devDependencies for environment-specific configuration options and better CI performance. adapter-auto itself takes no options.","adapter-auto automatically detects and uses the correct deployment adapter for supported hosting platforms, with option to install specific adapters for configuration and performance."],"uses":{"params":["name","path"]}}]}
