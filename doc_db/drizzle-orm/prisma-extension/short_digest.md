Extend Prisma client with Drizzle API to use both alongside each other. Install `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-prisma-generator`, add generator to schema, run `prisma generate`, extend client with `PrismaClient().$extends(drizzle())`, then use `prisma.$drizzle` for queries. Limitations: no relational queries, SQLite `.values()` unsupported, prepared statements limited.
