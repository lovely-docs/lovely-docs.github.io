- **Overview**: What agents are and why to use the Agent class
- **Building Agents**: Complete guide to creating agents with the Agent class
- **Workflow Patterns**: Structured patterns using core functions for complex workflows
- **Loop Control**: Advanced execution control with stopWhen and prepareStep
- **Configuring Call Options**: Pass type-safe runtime inputs to dynamically configure agent behavior
