SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications with Svelte. It's comparable to Next.js (for React developers) or Nuxt (for Vue developers).

**Svelte vs SvelteKit:**
- Svelte is a compiler that converts UI components into JavaScript and CSS
- SvelteKit adds the infrastructure needed for full applications: routing, build optimizations, offline support, preloading, configurable rendering (SSR, CSR, prerendering), image optimization, and hot module replacement via Vite

**Key capabilities:**
- Router that updates UI on navigation
- Build optimizations to load minimal code
- Offline support via service workers
- Page preloading before user navigation
- Configurable rendering modes (server-side, client-side, or build-time prerendering)
- Image optimization
- Fast development experience with HMR through Vite

SvelteKit handles modern best practices and common development challenges so you can focus on building.
