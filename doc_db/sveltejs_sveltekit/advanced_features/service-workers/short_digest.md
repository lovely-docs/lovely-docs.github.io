Service workers proxy network requests for offline support and precaching. Place `src/service-worker.js` for automatic registration. Access `$service-worker` module for build/static file paths and version. Example: cache app/static files on install, serve from cache with network fallback on fetch, clean old caches on activate. During dev, only ES module service workers work; use `{ type: dev ? 'module' : 'classic' }` for manual registration. Avoid caching large assets or stale data.
