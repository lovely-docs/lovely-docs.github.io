</page>

Based on the page above, in this order:
- Come up with a short filename that perfectly encompasses the contents.
    - Keep the original if it's good already.
    - Don't include the name of the library in the name.
    - If the original starts with a number, don't include it.
- Create a digest of the page.
    - Extract bits that are important to a programmer.
    - Don't include any extra notes. Be concise, no "guide to" or "documentation for", no water.
    - One example per use case max.
    - Combine 2 or more simple examples into one that showcases them all when possible.
    - Avoid markdown links, describe the target instead of linking.
- Shorter digest, keep only the most important information, condense examples as much as possible.
- One-line essence of the page.
- Is the page relevant to a programmer who is already somewhat familiar with {{ libname }}?
