Svelte 5 introduced significant API changes including runes, snippets, and event attributes. Svelte 3/4 features are now deprecated but still supported. The distinction between legacy mode and runes mode is important: once a component uses runes or sets `runes: true` compiler option, legacy mode features become unavailable. Svelte 3/4 syntax continues to work in Svelte 5 for backward compatibility. Users still on Svelte 3/4 or maintaining unmigrated components in Svelte 5 should reference this legacy documentation. For those exclusively using Svelte 3/4 syntax, the v4.svelte.dev documentation is available.
