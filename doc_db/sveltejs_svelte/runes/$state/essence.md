$state rune creates reactive state; plain values stay plain, arrays/objects become deep proxies; $state.raw for non-reactive, $state.snapshot for static snapshots, $state.eager for immediate updates; pass-by-value semantics require functions for reactive references; cross-module export requires property updates or getter functions.
