The `$app/environment` module provides access to environment variables and runtime information in SvelteKit applications.

This module exports environment-related utilities that allow you to:
- Access environment variables in both server and client contexts
- Determine the current runtime environment (development, production, etc.)
- Check build-time and runtime configuration

Key exports include variables for detecting the build mode and accessing environment configuration set during the build process.
