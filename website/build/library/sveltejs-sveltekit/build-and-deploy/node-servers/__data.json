This will create the production server in the output directory specified in the adapter options, defaulting to `build`.\n\nYou will need the output directory, the project's `package.json`, and the production dependencies in `node_modules` to run the application. Production dependencies can be generated by copying the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and then running `npm ci --omit dev` (you can skip this step if your app doesn't have any dependencies). You can then start your app with this command:\n\n```sh\nnode build\n```\n\nDevelopment dependencies will be bundled into your app using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). To control whether a given package is bundled or externalised, place it in `devDependencies` or `dependencies` respectively in your `package.json`.\n\n### Compressing responses\n\nYou will typically want to compress responses coming from the server. If you're already deploying your server behind a reverse proxy for SSL or load balancing, it typically results in better performance to also handle compression at that layer since Node.js is single-threaded.\n\nHowever, if you're building a [custom server](#Custom-server) and do want to add a compression middleware there, note that we would recommend using [`@polka/compression`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polka/compression) since SvelteKit streams responses and the more popular `compression` package does not support streaming and may cause errors when used.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nIn `dev` and `preview`, SvelteKit will read environment variables from your `.env` file (or `.env.local`, or `.env.[mode]`, [as determined by Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files).)\n\nIn production, `.env` files are _not_ automatically loaded. To do so, install `dotenv` in your project...\n\n```sh\nnpm install dotenv\n```\n\n...and invoke it before running the built app:\n\n```sh\nnode +++-r dotenv/config+++ build\n```\n\nIf you use Node.js v20.6+, you can use the [`--env-file`](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs) flag instead:\n\n```sh\nnode +++--env-file=.env+++ build\n```\n\n### `PORT`, `HOST` and `SOCKET_PATH`\n\nBy default, the server will accept connections on `0.0.0.0` using port 3000. These can be customised with the `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables:\n\n```sh\nHOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=4000 node build\n```\n\nAlternatively, the server can be configured to accept connections on a specified socket path. When this is done using the `SOCKET_PATH` environment variable, the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables will be disregarded.\n\n```sh\nSOCKET_PATH=/tmp/socket node build\n```\n\n### `ORIGIN`, `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `HOST_HEADER`, and `PORT_HEADER`\n\nHTTP doesn't give SvelteKit a reliable way to know the URL that is currently being requested. The simplest way to tell SvelteKit where the app is being served is to set the `ORIGIN` environment variable:\n\n```sh\nORIGIN=https://my.site node build\n\n# or e.g. for local previewing and testing\nORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 node build\n```\n\nWith this, a request for the `/stuff` pathname will correctly resolve to `https://my.site/stuff`. Alternatively, you can specify headers that tell SvelteKit about the request protocol and host, from which it can construct the origin URL:\n\n```sh\nPROTOCOL_HEADER=x-forwarded-proto HOST_HEADER=x-forwarded-host node build\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] [`x-forwarded-proto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto) and [`x-forwarded-host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host) are de facto standard headers that forward the original protocol and host if you're using a reverse proxy (think load balancers and CDNs). You should only set these variables if your server is behind a trusted reverse proxy; otherwise, it'd be possible for clients to spoof these headers.\n>\n> If you're hosting your proxy on a non-standard port and your reverse proxy supports `x-forwarded-port`, you can also set `PORT_HEADER=x-forwarded-port`.\n\nIf `adapter-node` can't correctly determine the URL of your deployment, you may experience this error when using [form actions](form-actions):\n\n> [!NOTE] Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden\n\n### `ADDRESS_HEADER` and `XFF_DEPTH`\n\nThe [`RequestEvent`](@sveltejs-kit#RequestEvent) object passed to hooks and endpoints includes an `event.getClientAddress()` function that returns the client's IP address. By default this is the connecting `remoteAddress`. If your server is behind one or more proxies (such as a load balancer), this value will contain the innermost proxy's IP address rather than the client's, so we need to specify an `ADDRESS_HEADER` to read the address from:\n\n```sh\nADDRESS_HEADER=True-Client-IP node build\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Headers can easily be spoofed. As with `PROTOCOL_HEADER` and `HOST_HEADER`, you should [know what you're doing](https://adam-p.ca/blog/2022/03/x-forwarded-for/) before setting these.\n\nIf the `ADDRESS_HEADER` is `X-Forwarded-For`, the header value will contain a comma-separated list of IP addresses. The `XFF_DEPTH` environment variable should specify how many trusted proxies sit in front of your server. E.g. if there are three trusted proxies, proxy 3 will forward the addresses of the original connection and the first two proxies:\n\n```\n\u003Cclient address>, \u003Cproxy 1 address>, \u003Cproxy 2 address>\n```\n\nSome guides will tell you to read the left-most address, but this leaves you [vulnerable to spoofing](https://adam-p.ca/blog/2022/03/x-forwarded-for/):\n\n```\n\u003Cspoofed address>, \u003Cclient address>, \u003Cproxy 1 address>, \u003Cproxy 2 address>\n```\n\nWe instead read from the _right_, accounting for the number of trusted proxies. In this case, we would use `XFF_DEPTH=3`.\n\n> [!NOTE] If you need to read the left-most address instead (and don't care about spoofing) — for example, to offer a geolocation service, where it's more important for the IP address to be _real_ than _trusted_, you can do so by inspecting the `x-forwarded-for` header within your app.\n\n### `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT`\n\nThe maximum request body size to accept in bytes including while streaming. The body size can also be specified with a unit suffix for kilobytes (`K`), megabytes (`M`), or gigabytes (`G`). For example, `512K` or `1M`. Defaults to 512kb. You can disable this option with a value of `Infinity` (0 in older versions of the adapter) and implement a custom check in [`handle`](hooks#Server-hooks-handle) if you need something more advanced.\n\n### `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`\n\nThe number of seconds to wait before forcefully closing any remaining connections after receiving a `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signal. Defaults to `30`. Internally the adapter calls [`closeAllConnections`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servercloseallconnections). See [Graceful shutdown](#Graceful-shutdown) for more details.\n\n### `IDLE_TIMEOUT`\n\nWhen using systemd socket activation, `IDLE_TIMEOUT` specifies the number of seconds after which the app is automatically put to sleep when receiving no requests. If not set, the app runs continuously. See [Socket activation](#Socket-activation) for more details.\n\n## Options\n\nThe adapter can be configured with various options:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 2307\n/// file: svelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter({\n\t\t\t// default options are shown\n\t\t\tout: 'build',\n\t\t\tprecompress: true,\n\t\t\tenvPrefix: ''\n\t\t})\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### out\n\nThe directory to build the server to. It defaults to `build` — i.e. `node build` would start the server locally after it has been created.\n\n### precompress\n\nEnables precompressing using gzip and brotli for assets and prerendered pages. It defaults to `true`.\n\n### envPrefix\n\nIf you need to change the name of the environment variables used to configure the deployment (for example, to deconflict with environment variables you don't control), you can specify a prefix:\n\n```js\nenvPrefix: 'MY_CUSTOM_';\n```\n\n```sh\nMY_CUSTOM_HOST=127.0.0.1 \\\nMY_CUSTOM_PORT=4000 \\\nMY_CUSTOM_ORIGIN=https://my.site \\\nnode build\n```\n\n## Graceful shutdown\n\nBy default `adapter-node` gracefully shuts down the HTTP server when a `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signal is received. It will:\n\n1. reject new requests ([`server.close`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#serverclosecallback))\n2. wait for requests that have already been made but not received a response yet to finish and close connections once they become idle ([`server.closeIdleConnections`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servercloseidleconnections))\n3. and finally, close any remaining connections that are still active after [`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`](#Environment-variables-SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT) seconds. ([`server.closeAllConnections`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servercloseallconnections))\n\n> [!NOTE] If you want to customize this behaviour you can use a [custom server](#Custom-server).\n\nYou can listen to the `sveltekit:shutdown` event which is emitted after the HTTP server has closed all connections. Unlike Node's `exit` event, the `sveltekit:shutdown` event supports asynchronous operations and is always emitted when all connections are closed even if the server has dangling work such as open database connections.\n\n```js\n// @errors: 2304\nprocess.on('sveltekit:shutdown', async (reason) => {\n  await jobs.stop();\n  await db.close();\n});\n```\n\nThe parameter `reason` has one of the following values:\n\n- `SIGINT` - shutdown was triggered by a `SIGINT` signal\n- `SIGTERM` - shutdown was triggered by a `SIGTERM` signal\n- `IDLE` - shutdown was triggered by [`IDLE_TIMEOUT`](#Environment-variables-IDLE_TIMEOUT)\n\n## Socket activation\n\nMost Linux operating systems today use a modern process manager called systemd to start the server and run and manage services. You can configure your server to allocate a socket and start and scale your app on demand. This is called [socket activation](https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activated-containers.html). In this case, the OS will pass two environment variables to your app — `LISTEN_PID` and `LISTEN_FDS`. The adapter will then listen on file descriptor 3 which refers to a systemd socket unit that you will have to create.\n\n> [!NOTE] You can still use [`envPrefix`](#Options-envPrefix) with systemd socket activation. `LISTEN_PID` and `LISTEN_FDS` are always read without a prefix.\n\nTo take advantage of socket activation follow these steps.\n\n1. Run your app as a [systemd service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html). It can either run directly on the host system or inside a container (using Docker or a systemd portable service for example). If you additionally pass an [`IDLE_TIMEOUT`](#Environment-variables-IDLE_TIMEOUT) environment variable to your app it will gracefully shutdown if there are no requests for `IDLE_TIMEOUT` seconds. systemd will automatically start your app again when new requests are coming in.\n\n```ini\n/// file: /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service\n[Service]\nEnvironment=NODE_ENV=production IDLE_TIMEOUT=60\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node /usr/bin/myapp/build\n```\n\n2. Create an accompanying [socket unit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html). The adapter only accepts a single socket.\n\n```ini\n/// file: /etc/systemd/system/myapp.socket\n[Socket]\nListenStream=3000\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=sockets.target\n```\n\n3. Make sure systemd has recognised both units by running `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`. Then enable the socket on boot and start it immediately using `sudo systemctl enable --now myapp.socket`. The app will then automatically start once the first request is made to `localhost:3000`.\n\n## Custom server\n\nThe adapter creates two files in your build directory — `index.js` and `handler.js`. Running `index.js` — e.g. `node build`, if you use the default build directory — will start a server on the configured port.\n\nAlternatively, you can import the `handler.js` file, which exports a handler suitable for use with [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) or [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) (or even just the built-in [`http.createServer`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener)) and set up your own server:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 2307 7006\n/// file: my-server.js\nimport { handler } from './build/handler.js';\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// add a route that lives separately from the SvelteKit app\napp.get('/healthcheck', (req, res) => {\n\tres.end('ok');\n});\n\n// let SvelteKit handle everything else, including serving prerendered pages and static assets\napp.use(handler);\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n\tconsole.log('listening on port 3000');\n});\n```\n","## Installation and Setup\n\nInstall `@sveltejs/adapter-node` and add to `svelte.config.js`:\n\n```js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\n\nconst config = {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter()\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n## Building and Running\n\nBuild with `npm run build` (outputs to `build` directory by default). Deploy the `build` directory, `package.json`, and production dependencies. Start with `node build`.\n\nDevelopment dependencies are bundled via Rollup. Control bundling by placing packages in `devDependencies` (bundled) or `dependencies` (external).\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n**In production**, `.env` files aren't auto-loaded. Load with:\n```sh\nnode -r dotenv/config build\n# or Node.js v20.6+:\nnode --env-file=.env build\n```\n\n**Server configuration:**\n- `PORT` (default 3000) and `HOST` (default 0.0.0.0)\n- `SOCKET_PATH` - use Unix socket instead of HOST/PORT\n- `ORIGIN` - set the deployment URL (e.g., `https://my.site`)\n- `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `HOST_HEADER`, `PORT_HEADER` - read from reverse proxy headers (e.g., `x-forwarded-proto`)\n- `ADDRESS_HEADER` - read client IP from header (e.g., `True-Client-IP`)\n- `XFF_DEPTH` - number of trusted proxies for `X-Forwarded-For` parsing\n- `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` - max request body (default 512kb, supports K/M/G suffixes)\n- `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` - seconds to wait before force-closing connections (default 30)\n- `IDLE_TIMEOUT` - seconds before auto-sleep with systemd socket activation\n\n## Adapter Options\n\n```js\nadapter({\n\tout: 'build',           // output directory\n\tprecompress: true,      // gzip/brotli compression\n\tenvPrefix: ''           // prefix for env vars (e.g., 'MY_CUSTOM_')\n})\n```\n\n## Compression\n\nFor custom servers, use `@polka/compression` instead of the popular `compression` package, as SvelteKit streams responses and `compression` doesn't support streaming.\n\n## Graceful Shutdown\n\nOn `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, the server rejects new requests, waits for in-flight requests to complete, then closes remaining connections after `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`. Listen to `sveltekit:shutdown` event for cleanup:\n\n```js\nprocess.on('sveltekit:shutdown', async (reason) => {\n  // reason: 'SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', or 'IDLE'\n  await db.close();\n});\n```\n\n## Socket Activation (systemd)\n\nConfigure systemd socket activation for on-demand app scaling. Create service and socket units, then systemd passes `LISTEN_PID` and `LISTEN_FDS` environment variables. The adapter listens on file descriptor 3.\n\n## Custom Server\n\nThe build outputs `index.js` (standalone server) and `handler.js` (middleware). Import `handler.js` for Express/Connect/Polka:\n\n```js\nimport { handler } from './build/handler.js';\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\napp.get('/healthcheck', (req, res) => res.end('ok'));\napp.use(handler);\napp.listen(3000);\n```","## Setup\n\nInstall `@sveltejs/adapter-node` and add to `svelte.config.js`. Build with `npm run build`, deploy `build/`, `package.json`, and `node_modules/`. Start with `node build`.\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n- `PORT` (3000), `HOST` (0.0.0.0), `SOCKET_PATH`\n- `ORIGIN` - deployment URL\n- `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `HOST_HEADER`, `PORT_HEADER` - reverse proxy headers\n- `ADDRESS_HEADER`, `XFF_DEPTH` - client IP detection\n- `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` (512kb), `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` (30s), `IDLE_TIMEOUT`\n\n## Adapter Options\n\n```js\nadapter({ out: 'build', precompress: true, envPrefix: '' })\n```\n\n## Custom Server\n\nImport `handler.js` for Express/Connect/Polka:\n\n```js\nimport { handler } from './build/handler.js';\nimport express from 'express';\napp.use(handler);\n```\n\n## Graceful Shutdown & systemd\n\nListen to `sveltekit:shutdown` event. Supports systemd socket activation with `LISTEN_PID`/`LISTEN_FDS`.","Deploy SvelteKit apps as standalone Node servers using adapter-node with environment variable configuration for proxies, ports, and graceful shutdown."],"uses":{"params":["name","path"]}}]}
