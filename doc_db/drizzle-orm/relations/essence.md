Define one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many table relationships using `one()` and `many()` operators; relations are application-level abstractions independent from database foreign keys; foreign key actions (CASCADE, RESTRICT, NO ACTION, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT) control delete/update behavior; use relationName to disambiguate multiple relations between same tables.
