SvelteKit automatically registers `src/service-worker.js` for offline support and performance. Access `$service-worker` module for build files, static assets, version, and base path. Implement install/activate/fetch handlers to cache assets and handle offline requests. Use version string for unique cache names. Disable auto-registration via config if needed. In dev, use `{ type: 'module' }` for manual registration.
