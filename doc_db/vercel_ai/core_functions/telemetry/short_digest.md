Enable OpenTelemetry telemetry with `experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true }` on function calls. Control input/output recording, add `functionId` and `metadata`, or provide custom `tracer`. Spans are recorded for generateText, streamText, generateObject, streamObject, embed, and embedMany functions with detailed attributes including model info, tokens, response data, and tool calls.
