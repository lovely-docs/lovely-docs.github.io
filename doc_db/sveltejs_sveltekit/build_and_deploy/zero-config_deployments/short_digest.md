## adapter-auto

Default adapter that auto-detects deployment environment and uses the correct adapter (Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, Azure, AWS SST, or Google Cloud Run).

Install the specific adapter to `devDependencies` for better CI performance and to use environment-specific configuration options. `adapter-auto` itself takes no options.
