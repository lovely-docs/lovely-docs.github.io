This page documents runtime warnings that can occur in Svelte applications. It covers two categories:

**Client warnings** - Warnings that occur in the browser during client-side execution, such as issues with component lifecycle, reactivity, or DOM manipulation.

**Shared warnings** - Warnings that can occur in both client and server contexts, covering common issues that apply across different runtime environments.

The specific warning messages and their explanations are generated from included documentation files that detail each warning type, when it occurs, and how to resolve it.
