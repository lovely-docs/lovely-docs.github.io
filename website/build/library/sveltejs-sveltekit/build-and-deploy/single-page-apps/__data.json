This page will be served for any URLs that can't be served by other means such as returning a prerendered page.\n\n> [!NOTE] SPA mode has a large negative performance impact by forcing multiple network round trips (for the blank HTML document, then for the JavaScript, and then for any data needed for the page) before content can be shown. Unless you are serving the app from a local network (e.g. a mobile app that wraps a locally-served SPA) this will delay startup, especially when considering the latency of mobile devices. It also harms SEO by often causing sites to be downranked for performance (SPAs are much more likely to fail [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals)), excluding search engines that don't render JS, and causing your site to receive less frequent updates from those that do. And finally, it makes your app inaccessible to users if JavaScript fails or is disabled (which happens [more often than you probably think](https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html)).\n>\n> You can avoid these drawbacks by [prerendering](#Prerendering-individual-pages) as many pages as possible when using SPA mode (especially your homepage). If you can prerender all pages, you can simply use [static site generation](adapter-static) rather than a SPA. Otherwise, you should strongly consider using an adapter which supports server side rendering. SvelteKit has officially supported adapters for various providers with generous free tiers.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, disable SSR for the pages you don't want to prerender. These pages will be served via the fallback page; for example, to serve all pages via the fallback by default, you can update the root layout as shown below. You should [opt back into prerendering individual pages and directories](#Prerendering-individual-pages) where possible.\n```js\n/// file: src/routes/+layout.js\nexport const ssr = false;\n```\n\nIf you don't have any server-side logic (i.e. `+page.server.js`, `+layout.server.js` or `+server.js` files) you can use [`adapter-static`](adapter-static) to create your SPA. Install `adapter-static` with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static` and add it to your `svelte.config.js` with the `fallback` option:\n\n```js\n/// file: svelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';\n\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter({\n\t\t\tfallback: '200.html' // may differ from host to host\n\t\t})\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\nThe `fallback` page is an HTML page created by SvelteKit from your page template (e.g. `app.html`) that loads your app and navigates to the correct route. For example [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing), a static web host, lets you add a `200.html` file that will handle any requests that don't correspond to static assets or prerendered pages.\n\nOn some hosts it may be something else entirely — consult your platform's documentation. We recommend avoiding `index.html` if possible as it may conflict with prerendering.\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that the fallback page will always contain absolute asset paths (i.e. beginning with `/` rather than `.`) regardless of the value of [`paths.relative`](configuration#paths), since it is used to respond to requests for arbitrary paths.\n\n## Prerendering individual pages\n\nIf you want certain pages to be prerendered, you can re-enable `ssr` alongside `prerender` for just those parts of your app:\n\n```js\n/// file: src/routes/my-prerendered-page/+page.js\nexport const prerender = true;\nexport const ssr = true;\n```\n\nYou won't need a Node server or server capable of running JavaScript to deploy this page. It will only server render your page while building your project for the purposes of outputting an `.html` page that can be served from any static web host.\n\n## Apache\n\nTo run an SPA on [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), you should add a `static/.htaccess` file to route requests to the fallback page:\n\n```\n\u003CIfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n\tRewriteEngine On\n\tRewriteBase /\n\tRewriteRule ^200\\.html$ - [L]\n\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n\tRewriteRule . /200.html [L]\n\u003C/IfModule>\n```\n","## Creating a Single-Page App\n\nTurn a SvelteKit app into a fully client-rendered SPA by specifying a fallback page that serves any URLs not handled by other means.\n\n### Setup\n\nDisable SSR for pages you don't want to prerender in your root layout:\n\n```js\n/// file: src/routes/+layout.js\nexport const ssr = false;\n```\n\nUse `adapter-static` with the `fallback` option:\n\n```js\n/// file: svelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';\n\nconst config = {\n\tkit: {\n\t\tadapter: adapter({\n\t\t\tfallback: '200.html'\n\t\t})\n\t}\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\nThe fallback page is an HTML file created from your app template that loads your app and navigates to the correct route. The specific filename depends on your host (e.g., Surge uses `200.html`).\n\n### Prerendering Individual Pages\n\nRe-enable SSR and add prerender for specific pages:\n\n```js\n/// file: src/routes/my-prerendered-page/+page.js\nexport const prerender = true;\nexport const ssr = true;\n```\n\nThese pages render at build time and output as static `.html` files, requiring no Node server to deploy.\n\n### Apache Configuration\n\nAdd `static/.htaccess` to route requests to the fallback page:\n\n```\n\u003CIfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n\tRewriteEngine On\n\tRewriteBase /\n\tRewriteRule ^200\\.html$ - [L]\n\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\n\tRewriteRule . /200.html [L]\n\u003C/IfModule>\n```\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nSPAs have significant drawbacks: multiple network round trips delay startup, harm SEO through performance penalties and Core Web Vitals failures, exclude non-JS-rendering search engines, and fail when JavaScript is disabled. Prerender as many pages as possible, especially the homepage. If all pages can be prerendered, use static site generation instead. Otherwise, use an adapter supporting server-side rendering.","## Single-Page App Setup\n\nDisable SSR globally and use `adapter-static` with a fallback page:\n\n```js\n// src/routes/+layout.js\nexport const ssr = false;\n\n// svelte.config.js\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';\nconst config = {\n\tkit: { adapter: adapter({ fallback: '200.html' }) }\n};\n```\n\nPrerender specific pages by enabling SSR and prerender for those routes:\n\n```js\nexport const prerender = true;\nexport const ssr = true;\n```\n\nFor Apache, add `.htaccess` to route unmatched requests to the fallback page.\n\n**Warning:** SPAs have poor performance, SEO, and accessibility.
