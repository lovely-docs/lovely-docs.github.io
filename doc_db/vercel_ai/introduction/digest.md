TypeScript toolkit for building AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

**Problem:** Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider.

**Solution:** The AI SDK standardizes integrating AI models across supported providers, letting developers focus on building applications rather than handling provider-specific technical details.

**Two main libraries:**
- AI SDK Core: Unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs
- AI SDK UI: Framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interfaces

**Supported providers:** Multiple model providers are supported (see providers section).

**Getting started:** Templates available for different use cases, providers, and frameworks, organized into categories: Starter Kits, Feature Exploration, Frameworks, Generative UI, and Security.

**Community:** Questions can be asked on the Vercel Community forum.

**Documentation access:** Full AI SDK documentation available in Markdown format at ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt for use with LLMs (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude, etc.). Usage: copy documentation contents, then prompt with format:
