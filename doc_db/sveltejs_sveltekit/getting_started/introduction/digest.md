## What is SvelteKit?

SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. It's similar to Next.js (for React developers) or Nuxt (for Vue developers).

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a compiler-based UI component framework. It converts components to JavaScript for rendering HTML and CSS for styling. Components are reusable UI elements like navigation bars, comment sections, or contact forms.

## SvelteKit vs Svelte

Svelte alone renders UI components. SvelteKit provides a complete web application framework with modern best practices and solutions to common development challenges.

**Key features:**
- Router that updates UI on link clicks
- Build optimizations to load minimal required code
- Offline support via service workers
- Page preloading before user navigation
- Configurable rendering modes: SSR (server-side), CSR (client-side), or prerendering at build-time
- Image optimization
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant code reflection in browser during development, powered by Vite with Svelte plugin

SvelteKit handles the complex modern best practices so developers can focus on the creative parts of building applications.
