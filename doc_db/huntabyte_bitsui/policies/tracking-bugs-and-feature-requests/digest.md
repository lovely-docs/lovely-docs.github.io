## Issues vs Discussions Policy

**Issues** are for:
- Reproducible bugs with clear steps to reproduce, error messages, screenshots, and expected vs actual behavior
- Confirmed problems relating to existing functionality
- Accepted feature requests that have been discussed, refined, and approved for implementation

**Discussions** are for:
- Feature requests (starting point before implementation)
- Design discussions before code is written
- Questions and support from community
- Brainstorming and exploring alternatives
- RFCs (Request for Comments) for structured feedback

**Feature Request Workflow:**
1. Start a Discussion describing the feature, benefits, and potential challenges
2. Gather feedback and refine the idea based on community input
3. Refine and finalize - if consensus is reached and deemed valuable, maintainer determines next steps
4. Issue Creation - once accepted for implementation, a maintainer or contributor creates an issue to track progress

**If a feature request is opened as an Issue:**
- Maintainer converts it to a Discussion (if not yet accepted)
- Explains the move with a comment linking to this policy
- Closes the original issue to keep tracker clean

This approach keeps the issue tracker focused on real bugs and planned features, avoids clutter, enables clear prioritization, and maintains a clean backlog for better project health.
