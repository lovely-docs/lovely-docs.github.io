**Generative AI**: Models that generate outputs (text, images, audio) based on learned patterns. Example: generating captions from photos.

**LLMs**: Text-focused models that predict likely word sequences. Train on massive text collections. Limitation: can hallucinate information not well-represented in training data.

**Embedding Models**: Convert data into vector representations showing semantic/syntactic relationships, used as input for other models.
