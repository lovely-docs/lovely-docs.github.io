Requires `netlify.toml` with build command and publish directory. Use `_redirects` file for redirect rules (higher priority than `netlify.toml`). Prerender Netlify Forms as HTML. Access Netlify context via `event.platform.context` in server endpoints. Use `read()` from `$app/server` instead of `fs` for file access.
