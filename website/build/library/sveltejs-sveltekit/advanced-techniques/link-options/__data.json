These can be applied to the `\u003Ca>` itself, or to a parent element.\n\nThese options also apply to `\u003Cform>` elements with [`method=\"GET\"`](form-actions#GET-vs-POST).\n\n## data-sveltekit-preload-data\n\nBefore the browser registers that the user has clicked on a link, we can detect that they've hovered the mouse over it (on desktop) or that a `touchstart` or `mousedown` event was triggered. In both cases, we can make an educated guess that a `click` event is coming.\n\nSvelteKit can use this information to get a head start on importing the code and fetching the page's data, which can give us an extra couple of hundred milliseconds — the difference between a user interface that feels laggy and one that feels snappy.\n\nWe can control this behaviour with the `data-sveltekit-preload-data` attribute, which can have one of two values:\n\n- `\"hover\"` means that preloading will start if the mouse comes to a rest over a link. On mobile, preloading begins on `touchstart`\n- `\"tap\"` means that preloading will start as soon as a `touchstart` or `mousedown` event is registered\n\nThe default project template has a `data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"hover\"` attribute applied to the `\u003Cbody>` element in `src/app.html`, meaning that every link is preloaded on hover by default:\n\n```html\n\u003Cbody data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"hover\">\n\t\u003Cdiv style=\"display: contents\">%sveltekit.body%\u003C/div>\n\u003C/body>\n```\n\nSometimes, calling `load` when the user hovers over a link might be undesirable, either because it's likely to result in false positives (a click needn't follow a hover) or because data is updating very quickly and a delay could mean staleness.\n\nIn these cases, you can specify the `\"tap\"` value, which causes SvelteKit to call `load` only when the user taps or clicks on a link:\n\n```html\n\u003Ca data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"tap\" href=\"/stonks\">\n\tGet current stonk values\n\u003C/a>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can also programmatically invoke `preloadData` from `$app/navigation`.\n\nData will never be preloaded if the user has chosen reduced data usage, meaning [`navigator.connection.saveData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/saveData) is `true`.\n\n## data-sveltekit-preload-code\n\nEven in cases where you don't want to preload _data_ for a link, it can be beneficial to preload the _code_. The `data-sveltekit-preload-code` attribute works similarly to `data-sveltekit-preload-data`, except that it can take one of four values, in decreasing 'eagerness':\n\n- `\"eager\"` means that links will be preloaded straight away\n- `\"viewport\"` means that links will be preloaded once they enter the viewport\n- `\"hover\"` - as above, except that only code is preloaded\n- `\"tap\"` - as above, except that only code is preloaded\n\nNote that `viewport` and `eager` only apply to links that are present in the DOM immediately following navigation — if a link is added later (in an `{#if ...}` block, for example) it will not be preloaded until triggered by `hover` or `tap`. This is to avoid performance pitfalls resulting from aggressively observing the DOM for changes.\n\n> [!NOTE] Since preloading code is a prerequisite for preloading data, this attribute will only have an effect if it specifies a more eager value than any `data-sveltekit-preload-data` attribute that is present.\n\nAs with `data-sveltekit-preload-data`, this attribute will be ignored if the user has chosen reduced data usage.\n\n## data-sveltekit-reload\n\nOccasionally, we need to tell SvelteKit not to handle a link, but allow the browser to handle it. Adding a `data-sveltekit-reload` attribute to a link...\n\n```html\n\u003Ca data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/path\">Path\u003C/a>\n```\n\n...will cause a full-page navigation when the link is clicked.\n\nLinks with a `rel=\"external\"` attribute will receive the same treatment. In addition, they will be ignored during [prerendering](page-options#prerender).\n\n## data-sveltekit-replacestate\n\nSometimes you don't want navigation to create a new entry in the browser's session history. Adding a `data-sveltekit-replacestate` attribute to a link...\n\n```html\n\u003Ca data-sveltekit-replacestate href=\"/path\">Path\u003C/a>\n```\n\n...will replace the current `history` entry rather than creating a new one with `pushState` when the link is clicked.\n\n## data-sveltekit-keepfocus\n\nSometimes you don't want [focus to be reset](accessibility#Focus-management) after navigation. For example, maybe you have a search form that submits as the user is typing, and you want to keep focus on the text input.  Adding a `data-sveltekit-keepfocus` attribute to it...\n\n```html\n\u003Cform data-sveltekit-keepfocus>\n\t\u003Cinput type=\"text\" name=\"query\">\n\u003C/form>\n```\n\n...will cause the currently focused element to retain focus after navigation. In general, avoid using this attribute on links, since the focused element would be the `\u003Ca>` tag (and not a previously focused element) and screen reader and other assistive technology users often expect focus to be moved after a navigation. You should also only use this attribute on elements that still exist after navigation. If the element no longer exists, the user's focus will be lost, making for a confusing experience for assistive technology users.\n\n## data-sveltekit-noscroll\n\nWhen navigating to internal links, SvelteKit mirrors the browser's default navigation behaviour: it will change the scroll position to 0,0 so that the user is at the very top left of the page (unless the link includes a `#hash`, in which case it will scroll to the element with a matching ID).\n\nIn certain cases, you may wish to disable this behaviour. Adding a `data-sveltekit-noscroll` attribute to a link...\n\n```html\n\u003Ca href=\"path\" data-sveltekit-noscroll>Path\u003C/a>\n```\n\n...will prevent scrolling after the link is clicked.\n\n## Disabling options\n\nTo disable any of these options inside an element where they have been enabled, use the `\"false\"` value:\n\n```html\n\u003Cdiv data-sveltekit-preload-data>\n\t\u003C!-- these links will be preloaded -->\n\t\u003Ca href=\"/a\">a\u003C/a>\n\t\u003Ca href=\"/b\">b\u003C/a>\n\t\u003Ca href=\"/c\">c\u003C/a>\n\n\t\u003Cdiv data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"false\">\n\t\t\u003C!-- these links will NOT be preloaded -->\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"/d\">d\u003C/a>\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"/e\">e\u003C/a>\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"/f\">f\u003C/a>\n\t\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\nTo apply an attribute to an element conditionally, do this:\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cdiv data-sveltekit-preload-data={condition ? 'hover' : false}>\n```\n","## Link Navigation Attributes\n\nSvelteKit uses standard `\u003Ca>` elements for navigation.
