If you're coming from React, SvelteKit is similar to Next. If you're coming from Vue, SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt.\n\nTo learn more about the kinds of applications you can build with SvelteKit, see the [documentation regarding project types](project-types).\n\n## What is Svelte?\n\nIn short, Svelte is a way of writing user interface components — like a navigation bar, comment section, or contact form — that users see and interact with in their browsers. The Svelte compiler converts your components to JavaScript that can be run to render the HTML for the page and to CSS that styles the page. You don't need to know Svelte to understand the rest of this guide, but it will help. If you'd like to learn more, check out [the Svelte tutorial](/tutorial).\n\n## SvelteKit vs Svelte\n\nSvelte renders UI components. You can compose these components and render an entire page with just Svelte, but you need more than just Svelte to write an entire app.\n\nSvelteKit helps you build web apps while following modern best practices and providing solutions to common development challenges. It offers everything from basic functionalities — like a [router](glossary#Routing) that updates your UI when a link is clicked — to more advanced capabilities. Its extensive list of features includes [build optimizations](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#build-optimizations) to load only the minimal required code; [offline support](service-workers); [preloading](link-options#data-sveltekit-preload-data) pages before user navigation; [configurable rendering](page-options) to handle different parts of your app on the server via [SSR](glossary#SSR), in the browser through [client-side rendering](glossary#CSR), or at build-time with [prerendering](glossary#Prerendering); [image optimization](images); and much more. Building an app with all the modern best practices is fiendishly complicated, but SvelteKit does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.\n\nIt reflects changes to your code in the browser instantly to provide a lightning-fast and feature-rich development experience by leveraging [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with a [Svelte plugin](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte) to do [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/docs/config.md#hot).\n","SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications with Svelte. It's comparable to Next.js (for React developers) or Nuxt (for Vue developers).\n\n**Svelte vs SvelteKit:**\n- Svelte is a compiler that converts UI components into JavaScript and CSS\n- SvelteKit adds the infrastructure needed for full applications: routing, build optimizations, offline support, preloading, configurable rendering (SSR, CSR, prerendering), image optimization, and hot module replacement via Vite\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- Router that updates UI on navigation\n- Build optimizations to load minimal code\n- Offline support via service workers\n- Page preloading before user navigation\n- Configurable rendering modes (server-side, client-side, or build-time prerendering)\n- Image optimization\n- Fast development experience with HMR through Vite\n\nSvelteKit handles modern best practices and common development challenges so you can focus on building.","SvelteKit is a framework for building web apps with Svelte (comparable to Next.js or Nuxt).
