Stream custom data alongside model responses using `createUIMessageStream` and `createUIMessageStreamResponse`. Define type-safe data schemas in custom UIMessage type. Three data types: persistent data parts (added to `message.parts`), sources (for RAG), and transient parts (only via `onData` callback, not persisted). Reconcile data parts by reusing same ID. Client processes via `onData` callback for transient data and by filtering `message.parts` for persistent data. Use cases: RAG sources, loading states, collaborative artifacts, analytics, notifications.
