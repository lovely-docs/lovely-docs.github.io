The page serves as the main entry point to the API reference documentation for the AI SDK. It provides an overview of four main modules:

1. **AI SDK Core** - Enables switching between different model providers without changing application code.

2. **AI SDK RSC** - Allows using React Server Components to stream user interfaces to the client.

3. **AI SDK UI** - Provides hooks for integrating user interfaces that interact with language models.

4. **Stream Helpers** - Offers special functions to help stream model generations from various providers.

Each module is presented as a card with a title, description, and link to its detailed reference documentation.
