## Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

LLMs predict likely text sequences based on training data. Prompt engineering shapes responses through instruction clarity, examples, and model settings.

**Techniques:**
- **Clear instructions:** "organic coffee shop" produces better results than generic "coffee shop"
- **Examples:** Demonstrate expected output patterns to guide the model toward desired results
- **Temperature setting:** Controls randomness (0 = deterministic, 1 = varied). Use ~0.6 for diverse suggestions.

**Cost-Performance Tradeoff:** Different models vary in cost, speed, and effectiveness (e.g., GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5-turbo).
