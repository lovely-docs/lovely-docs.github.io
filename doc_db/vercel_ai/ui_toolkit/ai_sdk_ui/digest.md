The AI SDK UI module provides a collection of tools and patterns for building user interfaces that interact with AI models. It includes:

**Core Components & Patterns:**
- Overview: Introduction to AI SDK UI capabilities and architecture
- Chatbot: Integration patterns for building conversational interfaces
- Chatbot Message Persistence: Storing and loading chat message history
- Chatbot Tool Usage: Integrating tool calling capabilities into chatbots
- Completion: Text completion interface integration
- Object Generation: Structured object generation from AI models
- Streaming Data: Real-time data streaming from backend to frontend
- Reading UI Message Streams: Consuming UIMessage streams for terminal UIs, custom clients, and server components
- Error Handling: Error management and recovery patterns
- Stream Protocol: Specification for backend-to-frontend data transmission

The module covers both high-level use cases (chatbots, completions, object generation) and low-level concerns (stream protocols, message persistence, error handling).
