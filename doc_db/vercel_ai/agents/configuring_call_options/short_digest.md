Call options provide type-safe runtime configuration of agents through `callOptionsSchema` (Zod schema) and `prepareCall` (function to modify settings). Use cases: inject dynamic context into prompts, select models by complexity, configure tools per request, set provider options, fetch and inject RAG context (async supported), combine multiple modifications. Pass options to `generate()`/`stream()` or through `createAgentUIStreamResponse` in API routes.
