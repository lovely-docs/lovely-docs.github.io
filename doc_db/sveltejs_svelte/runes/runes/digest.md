This page serves as the index/introduction to the Runes section of Svelte documentation. Runes are a core concept in Svelte for managing reactivity and state. The page itself appears to be a structural/organizational page that introduces the runes documentation section, with the actual detailed content about specific runes (like $state, $derived, $effect, etc.) contained in separate pages within this section.
