Declares computed state with `$derived(expression)` or `$derived.by(function)` that automatically updates when dependencies change. Expressions must be side-effect free. Can be temporarily overridden for optimistic UI. Uses push-pull reactivity: changes notify dependents immediately but derived values only recalculate when read. Destructuring creates reactive variables for each property.
