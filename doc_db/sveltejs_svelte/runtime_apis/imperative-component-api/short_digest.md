Four functions for component lifecycle: `mount()` instantiates and attaches to DOM, `unmount()` removes with optional transitions, `render()` (server-only) converts to HTML strings, `hydrate()` reuses server HTML and makes it interactive. Effects don't run during mount/hydrate without `flushSync()`.
