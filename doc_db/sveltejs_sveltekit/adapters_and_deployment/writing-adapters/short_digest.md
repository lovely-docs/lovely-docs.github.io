Adapters export a function returning an `Adapter` object with required `name` and `adapt(builder)` properties, plus optional `emulate()` and `supports` methods. The `adapt` method must clear build dir, write output via `builder.writeClient/Server/Prerendered()`, instantiate the app with `builder.generateManifest()`, listen for requests, call `server.respond()`, expose platform info, shim `fetch` if needed, bundle output, and place files correctly for the target platform.
