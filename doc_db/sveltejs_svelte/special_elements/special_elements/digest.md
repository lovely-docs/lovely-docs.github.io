This page serves as an index/overview for Svelte's special elements documentation. Special elements in Svelte are built-in components and directives that provide core functionality for component behavior, reactivity, and template control. They include elements like `<svelte:self>` for recursive components, `<svelte:component>` for dynamic component rendering, `<svelte:window>` for window event binding, `<svelte:body>` for body element event binding, `<svelte:head>` for adding content to the document head, `<svelte:options>` for component compile options, and `<svelte:fragment>` for grouping elements without adding a wrapper node.
