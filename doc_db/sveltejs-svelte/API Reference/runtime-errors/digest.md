This page documents runtime errors that can occur in Svelte applications, organized into three categories:

**Client errors** - Errors that occur in the browser during client-side execution.

**Server errors** - Errors that occur on the server during server-side rendering or backend operations.

**Shared errors** - Errors that can occur in both client and server environments.

Each category includes detailed error descriptions and guidance for debugging and resolving issues specific to that context.
