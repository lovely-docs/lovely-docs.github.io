shadcn-svelte is a Svelte/SvelteKit port of shadcn/ui, maintained by Huntabyte and CokaKoala with community contributions.

The project builds on several key open source libraries:
- Bits UI provides headless components
- Formsnap provides form components
- Paneforge provides resizable components
- Vaul Svelte provides drawer components
- Radix UI provided the original headless components and examples that shadcn/ui was built on

The original shadcn/ui was created by shadcn, with typography adapted from Shu Ding's work on Nextra, and button styles inspired by Cal.com.
