It's the official application framework from the Svelte team and powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/). Create a new project with:\n\n```bash\nnpx sv create myapp\ncd myapp\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nDon't worry if you don't know Svelte yet! You can ignore all the nice features SvelteKit brings on top for now and dive into it later.\n\n## Alternatives to SvelteKit\n\nYou can also use Svelte directly with Vite by running `npm create vite@latest` and selecting the `svelte` option. With this, `npm run build` will generate HTML, JS, and CSS files inside the `dist` directory using [vite-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte). In most cases, you will probably need to [choose a routing library](faq#Is-there-a-router) as well.\n\n>[!NOTE] Vite is often used in standalone mode to build [single page apps (SPAs)](../kit/glossary#SPA), which you can also [build with SvelteKit](../kit/single-page-apps).\n\nThere are also plugins for [Rollup](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte), [Webpack](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader) [and a few others](https://sveltesociety.dev/packages?category=build-plugins), but we recommend Vite.\n\n## Editor tooling\n\nThe Svelte team maintains a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode), and there are integrations with various other [editors](https://sveltesociety.dev/resources#editor-support) and tools as well.\n\nYou can also check your code from the command line using [sv check](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).\n\n## Getting help\n\nDon't be shy about asking for help in the [Discord chatroom](/chat)! You can also find answers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/svelte).\n","## Setup with SvelteKit (recommended)\n\n```bash\nnpx sv create myapp\ncd myapp\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nSvelteKit is the official application framework from the Svelte team, powered by Vite.

You'll likely need to add a routing library separately.\n\n## Other build tools\n\nPlugins exist for Rollup, Webpack, and others, but Vite is recommended.\n\n## Editor support\n\n- VS Code extension maintained by Svelte team\n- Integrations available for various other editors\n- Command-line checking with `sv check`\n\n## Getting help\n\nAsk in the Discord chatroom or Stack Overflow (tag: svelte).","**Recommended setup:**\n```bash\nnpx sv create myapp\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**Alternative with Vite:**\n```bash\nnpm create vite@latest  # select svelte\nnpm run build\n```\n\nVite is recommended over Rollup/Webpack.
