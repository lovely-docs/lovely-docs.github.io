AI SDK RSC is an experimental feature for building AI-powered applications using React Server Components. It provides capabilities for streaming React components, managing generative UI state, saving and restoring application states, building multi-step interfaces, streaming values, error handling, and authentication.

Key features include:
- Streaming React Components: Send React components from server to client in real-time
- Generative UI State Management: Handle dynamic UI state generated by AI
- State Persistence: Save and restore application states for continuity
- Multi-step Interfaces: Build complex workflows with multiple steps
- Value Streaming: Stream data values alongside components
- Error Handling: Manage errors in AI operations
- Authentication: Secure user access to AI features

Note: AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. For production use, AI SDK UI is recommended. Migration guidance from RSC to UI is available.
