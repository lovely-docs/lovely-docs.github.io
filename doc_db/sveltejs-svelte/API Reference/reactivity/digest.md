The `svelte/reactivity` module provides reactive versions of JavaScript built-ins including Map, Set, and URL. These reactive versions work identically to their native counterparts but integrate with Svelte's reactivity system, allowing changes to these data structures to automatically trigger component updates. The module also includes additional utilities for managing reactivity in Svelte applications.
