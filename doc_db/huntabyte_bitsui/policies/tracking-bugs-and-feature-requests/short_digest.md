**Issues**: Reproducible bugs and accepted feature requests ready for implementation. **Discussions**: Feature requests, design discussions, questions, brainstorming, and RFCs. Feature requests start as discussions, get refined through community feedback, and only become issues once accepted for implementation. If a feature request is opened as an issue, maintainers convert it to a discussion and close the issue.
