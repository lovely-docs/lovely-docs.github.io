The `svelte/compiler` module provides programmatic access to the Svelte compiler. This module allows developers to compile Svelte components to JavaScript at runtime or build time, rather than relying solely on build tool integrations.

Key capabilities include:
- Compiling `.svelte` files to JavaScript output
- Accessing compiler internals for advanced use cases
- Integrating Svelte compilation into custom build pipelines
- Analyzing component metadata and AST information

This is useful for build tool authors, framework integrators, and developers building custom tooling around Svelte.
