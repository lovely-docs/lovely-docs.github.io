Context allows parent components to share values with descendants without prop-drilling. Use `setContext(key, value)` in parent and `getContext(key)` in child. For type safety, use `createContext<T>()` which returns getter/setter pair. Store reactive state in context by mutating the object directly, not reassigning. Context is request-isolated, unlike module-level state.
