On the client this component is mounted to a specific element. On the server, you want to get back a string of HTML instead which you can render. The following functions help you achieve those tasks.\n\n## `mount`\n\nInstantiates a component and mounts it to the given target:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 2322\nimport { mount } from 'svelte';\nimport App from './App.svelte';\n\nconst app = mount(App, {\n\ttarget: document.querySelector('#app'),\n\tprops: { some: 'property' }\n});\n```\n\nYou can mount multiple components per page, and you can also mount from within your application, for example when creating a tooltip component and attaching it to the hovered element.\n\nNote that unlike calling `new App(...)` in Svelte 4, things like effects (including `onMount` callbacks, and action functions) will not run during `mount`. If you need to force pending effects to run (in the context of a test, for example) you can do so with `flushSync()`.\n\n## `unmount`\n\nUnmounts a component that was previously created with [`mount`](#mount) or [`hydrate`](#hydrate).\n\nIf `options.outro` is `true`, [transitions](transition) will play before the component is removed from the DOM:\n\n```js\nimport { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';\nimport App from './App.svelte';\n\nconst app = mount(App, { target: document.body });\n\n// later\nunmount(app, { outro: true });\n```\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise.\n\n## `render`\n\nOnly available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option. Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 2724 2305 2307\nimport { render } from 'svelte/server';\nimport App from './App.svelte';\n\nconst result = render(App, {\n\tprops: { some: 'property' }\n});\nresult.body; // HTML for somewhere in this \u003Cbody> tag\nresult.head; // HTML for somewhere in this \u003Chead> tag\n```\n\n## `hydrate`\n\nLike `mount`, but will reuse up any HTML rendered by Svelte's SSR output (from the [`render`](#render) function) inside the target and make it interactive:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 2322\nimport { hydrate } from 'svelte';\nimport App from './App.svelte';\n\nconst app = hydrate(App, {\n\ttarget: document.querySelector('#app'),\n\tprops: { some: 'property' }\n});\n```\n\nAs with `mount`, effects will not run during `hydrate` — use `flushSync()` immediately afterwards if you need them to.\n","## mount\nInstantiates and mounts a component to a DOM element:\n```js\nimport { mount } from 'svelte';\nimport App from './App.svelte';\n\nconst app = mount(App, {\n\ttarget: document.querySelector('#app'),\n\tprops: { some: 'property' }\n});\n```\nMultiple components can be mounted per page. Effects and onMount callbacks do not run during mount; use `flushSync()` to force them if needed.\n\n## unmount\nRemoves a component created with mount or hydrate:\n```js\nimport { unmount } from 'svelte';\nunmount(app, { outro: true });\n```\nReturns a Promise that resolves after transitions complete if `outro` is true, otherwise resolves immediately.\n\n## render\nServer-only function that returns an object with `body` and `head` properties for server-side rendering:\n```js\nimport { render } from 'svelte/server';\nimport App from './App.svelte';\n\nconst result = render(App, { props: { some: 'property' } });\nresult.body; // HTML for \u003Cbody>\nresult.head; // HTML for \u003Chead>\n```\n\n## hydrate\nLike mount, but reuses HTML from server-side rendering to make it interactive:\n```js\nimport { hydrate } from 'svelte';\nconst app = hydrate(App, {\n\ttarget: document.querySelector('#app'),\n\tprops: { some: 'property' }\n});\n```\nEffects do not run during hydrate; use `flushSync()` afterwards if needed.","## mount\nInstantiates and mounts a component to a DOM element.
