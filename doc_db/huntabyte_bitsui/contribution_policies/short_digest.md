**Changelog Format:** `- <type>(<scope>): <description>` with types (fix, feat, improve, chore, docs), component scopes, and concise descriptions.

**Issues vs Discussions:** Issues track bugs and approved features; Discussions are for proposing and refining features before implementation. Feature requests start as Discussions, then become Issues once approved.
