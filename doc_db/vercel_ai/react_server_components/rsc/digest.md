AI SDK RSC is an experimental feature for building AI-powered applications using React Server Components. It provides capabilities for streaming React components, managing generative UI state, saving/restoring states, building multi-step interfaces, streaming values, error handling, and authentication.

Key topics covered:
- **Streaming React Components**: Stream React components from the server to the client
- **Managing Generative UI State**: Handle state for AI-generated UI elements
- **Saving and Restoring States**: Persist and recover application state
- **Multi-step Interfaces**: Build complex workflows with multiple steps
- **Streaming Values**: Stream data values alongside components
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors in RSC-based applications
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication

⚠️ **Warning**: AI SDK RSC is experimental. For production use, the AI SDK UI is recommended instead. A migration guide from RSC to UI is available.
