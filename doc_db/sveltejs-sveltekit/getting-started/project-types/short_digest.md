SvelteKit supports multiple rendering modes: default (SSR + CSR), static site generation, SPAs, multi-page apps, and various deployment targets (serverless, own server, containers, mobile, desktop, browser extensions). Use adapter-node for own servers/containers, adapter-static for static generation, adapter-vercel/netlify/cloudflare for serverless. For mobile/embedded with HTTP/1 limits, use `bundleStrategy: 'single'`.
