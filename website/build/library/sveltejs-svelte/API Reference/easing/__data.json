These functions take a value between 0 and 1 (representing progress through an animation) and return an eased value, allowing you to create smooth, natural-looking motion effects.\n\nCommon easing functions include:\n- Linear: constant speed\n- Quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic: polynomial easing with varying intensity\n- Sine, exponential, circular: smooth curves with different characteristics\n- Elastic, back, bounce: specialized effects for springy or bouncy animations\n\nExample usage in a Svelte transition:\n```javascript\nimport { quintOut } from 'svelte/easing';\n\ntransition:fade={{ duration: 300, easing: quintOut }}\n```","The `svelte/easing` module provides easing functions (linear, quadratic, cubic, sine, exponential, elastic, bounce, etc.) that transform animation progress values (0-1) into eased values for smooth motion effects. Use them with transitions and animations via the `easing` parameter.","Module providing easing functions for animations and transitions in Svelte."],"uses":{"params":["name","path"]}}]}
