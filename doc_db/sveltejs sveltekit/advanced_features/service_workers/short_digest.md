SvelteKit automatically registers `src/service-worker.js` for offline support and precaching. Access `$service-worker` module for assets, build files, version, and base path. Example caches built app and static files on install, removes old caches on activate, and serves from cache with network fallback on fetch. During development, manually register with `{ type: dev ? 'module' : 'classic' }`. Alternatives: Workbox or Vite PWA plugin.
