Agents are systems where large language models use tools in a loop to accomplish tasks. The documentation covers five key areas:

1. **Overview** - Foundational concepts of what agents are and when to use the Agent class.

2. **Building Agents** - Complete guide to creating agents using the Agent class, covering implementation details and setup.

3. **Workflow Patterns** - Structured patterns using core functions for implementing complex workflows with agents.

4. **Loop Control** - Advanced execution control mechanisms including `stopWhen` and `prepareStep` for fine-grained control over agent execution loops.

5. **Configuring Call Options** - Type-safe runtime inputs for dynamically configuring agent behavior at execution time.
