## Issues vs Discussions

**Issues** are for:
- Reproducible bugs with clear steps to reproduce, error messages, and expected vs actual behavior
- Confirmed problems in existing functionality
- Accepted feature requests that have been discussed and approved for implementation

**Discussions** are for:
- Feature requests (starting point before implementation)
- Design discussions and brainstorming
- Questions and community support
- RFCs (Request for Comments)

## Feature Request Workflow

Feature requests follow this process:
1. Start a Discussion describing the feature, benefits, and challenges
2. Gather feedback and refine based on community input
3. If consensus is reached and maintainers deem it valuable, proceed to step 4
4. Maintainer creates an Issue to track implementation progress

If a feature request is opened as an Issue instead of a Discussion, maintainers will convert it to a Discussion, explain the move with a comment linking to this policy, and close the original Issue.
