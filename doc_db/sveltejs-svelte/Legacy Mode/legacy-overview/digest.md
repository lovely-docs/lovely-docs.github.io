Svelte 5 introduced runes, snippets, and event attributes, deprecating some Svelte 3/4 features. Legacy mode features are available in Svelte 5 until a component opts into runes mode (by using runes or setting `runes: true` compiler option). Once in runes mode, legacy features are no longer available. Svelte 3/4 syntax still works in Svelte 5 for backward compatibility. For Svelte 3/4 specific documentation, refer to v4.svelte.dev.
