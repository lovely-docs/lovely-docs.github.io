The `$env/static/private` module provides access to private environment variables that are only available on the server side during build time. These variables are statically replaced at build time and cannot be accessed from the browser or client-side code. Use this module to securely handle sensitive configuration like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets that should never be exposed to the client.
