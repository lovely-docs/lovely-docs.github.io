Reassigning or mutating these variables (`count += 1` or `object.x = y`) will cause the UI to update.\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cscript>\n\tlet count = 0;\n\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cbutton on:click={() => count += 1}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\nBecause Svelte's legacy mode reactivity is based on _assignments_, using array methods like `.push()` and `.splice()` won't automatically trigger updates. A subsequent assignment is required to 'tell' the compiler to update the UI:\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cscript>\n\tlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n\tfunction addNumber() {\n\t\t// this method call does not trigger an update\n\t\tnumbers.push(numbers.length + 1);\n\n\t\t// this assignment will update anything\n\t\t// that depends on `numbers`\n\t\tnumbers = numbers;\n\t}\n\u003C/script>\n```\n","## Reactive let/var declarations in legacy mode\n\nIn legacy mode, top-level variables are automatically reactive. Reassigning or mutating them triggers UI updates.\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cscript>\n\tlet count = 0;\n\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cbutton on:click={() => count += 1}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\nReactivity is based on assignments, not mutations. Array methods like `.push()` and `.splice()` won't trigger updates—you must reassign the variable afterward:\n\n```svelte\n\u003Cscript>\n\tlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n\tfunction addNumber() {\n\t\tnumbers.push(numbers.length + 1); // doesn't trigger update\n\t\tnumbers = numbers; // reassignment triggers update\n\t}\n\u003C/script>\n```","## Reactive let/var in legacy mode\n\nTop-level variables are automatically reactive. Reactivity is assignment-based, so mutations like `.push()` require a reassignment to trigger updates:\n\n```svelte\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nnumbers.push(5); // no update\nnumbers = numbers; // triggers update\n```","Legacy mode makes top-level variables reactive via assignments; mutations alone don't trigger updates without reassignment."],"uses":{"params":["name","path"]}}]}
