## Bits UI Overview

Bits UI is a headless component library for Svelte emphasizing developer experience, accessibility, and creative control.

### Key Features

**Unstyled Components**: Most components ship completely unstyled with no CSS resets or design system assumptions. Styling is applied via standard `class` props or `data-*` attributes.

**Developer Experience**: Full TypeScript coverage, stable APIs, flexible event override system, great defaults that are easily overridden, and comprehensive documentation.

**Accessibility**: WAI-ARIA compliant, keyboard navigation by default, built-in focus management and screen reader support.

**Composable Design**: Components are primitives that compose cleanly. Supports render delegation for flexibility, chainable events and callbacks, override-friendly defaults, and minimal dependencies.

### Community & Credits

Maintained by Hunter Johnston with design support from Pavel Stianko and Bitworks Studio, and tooling support from Adrian Gonz. Built on inspiration from Melt UI (internal architecture), Radix UI (API design), and React Spectrum (date/time components and accessibility patterns).
