The API Reference is the main entry point for the SDK documentation, organizing four core modules:

**AI SDK Core** - Provides a unified interface to switch between different model providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) without changing application code. Enables provider-agnostic model integration.

**AI SDK RSC** - Enables streaming of user interfaces to clients using React Server Components. Allows server-side rendering with real-time UI updates streamed from the server.

**AI SDK UI** - Provides React hooks for building user interfaces that interact with language models. Simplifies client-side integration of AI capabilities into React applications.

**Stream Helpers** - Offers utility functions for streaming model generations from various providers. Handles the mechanics of streaming responses from different AI services.
