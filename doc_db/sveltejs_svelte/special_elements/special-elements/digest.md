This page serves as an index/overview for special elements in Svelte. The actual content appears to be generated automatically from a script and the page itself contains only the title and metadata. No specific examples or detailed information about special elements are provided on this page - it functions as a structural entry point to documentation about Svelte's special elements (such as `<svelte:component>`, `<svelte:window>`, `<svelte:body>`, `<svelte:head>`, `<svelte:options>`, and `<svelte:fragment>`).
