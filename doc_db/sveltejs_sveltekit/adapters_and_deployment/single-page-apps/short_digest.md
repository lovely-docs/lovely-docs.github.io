Configure SPA mode with fallback page using `adapter-static` and `fallback` option. Disable SSR globally with `export const ssr = false` in root layout, then selectively re-enable with `export const prerender = true; export const ssr = true` for individual pages. Note performance/SEO drawbacks; prerender as many pages as possible. For Apache, add `.htaccess` rewrite rules to route requests to fallback page.
