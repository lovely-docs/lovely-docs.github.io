## Quick Start

Run `npx sv create my-app` to scaffold a new SvelteKit project. This command prompts you to set up basic tooling like TypeScript. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server on localhost:5173.

## Core Concepts

- Each page is a Svelte component
- Create pages by adding files to `src/routes` directory
- Pages are server-rendered on first visit for performance, then a client-side app takes over

## Editor Setup

Visual Studio Code with the Svelte extension is recommended, though other editors are supported.
