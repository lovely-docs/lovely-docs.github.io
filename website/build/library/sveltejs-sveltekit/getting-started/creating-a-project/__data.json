See [the CLI docs](/docs/cli/overview) for information about these options and [the integrations page](./integrations) for pointers on setting up additional tooling. `npm run dev` will then start the development server on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) - make sure you install dependencies before running this if you didn't do so during project creation.\n\nThere are two basic concepts:\n\n- Each page of your app is a [Svelte](../svelte) component\n- You create pages by adding files to the `src/routes` directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over\n\nTry editing the files to get a feel for how everything works.\n\n## Editor setup\n\nWe recommend using [Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with [the Svelte extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode), but [support also exists for numerous other editors](https://sveltesociety.dev/resources#editor-support).\n","## Quick Start\n\nRun `npx sv create my-app` to scaffold a new SvelteKit project.
