Compile Svelte components to web components with `customElement: true`. Specify tag name in `<svelte:options customElement="tag-name">`. Props are exposed as DOM element properties/attributes. Configure with `customElement` object: `tag`, `shadow: "none"`, `props` (with `attribute`, `reflect`, `type`), and `extend` function for lifecycle customization. Styles are encapsulated and inlined; slotted content renders eagerly; context doesn't cross custom element boundaries.
